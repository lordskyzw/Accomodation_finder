# Accomodation_finder



This website makes it easier to find proper accommodation in different areas according to people's requirements.
This will be especially beneficial to the college students who are in search of an accommodation.
This will create a proper database of all the proper living accommodations nearby various institutes. 
This website will be helpful to the people coming from out of town, they wonâ€™t have to roam around in search for a proper accommodation.
Different owners can list their houses on the website with complete specifications of rooms available. 
If the project is successful, it will lead to an increase in the competition and decrease in the prices of the houses.

I am using mysql for database, php for backend, javascript, bootstrap and html for front-end. 


-host the website on hostinger or aws or run on localhost using xampp or apache.
